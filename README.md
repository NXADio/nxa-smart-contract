<h3 align="center">Nxad smart contract</h3>
<p align="center">This current contract is NEP5 Compliant</p>

#### Description

NXAD is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform for sharing of content and online advertising. 
On NXAD “advertisers” create ads simply based on any link (URL) on which they want traffic and attach a token reward. 
Anyone can then discover ads from the NXAD pool, generate a personal sharing link from the ads they like, and share their link on social networks and all other channels.
Each unique click on their personal sharing link earns those “sharers” a token reward. Think of it as the bit.ly of affiliate marketing!
With NXAD we intend to bring back the value to the users themselves by offering an alternative way of content sharing and online advertising which is more simple, decentralized, and effective! 
NXAD has the potential to bring mass adoption of blockchain technology to the world – just by its simplicity and scalability! And it works – just everywhere.

#### Considerations

The current smart contract is the first version of Nxad smart contract.
With this in mind, some modifications will still occur.
The smart contract is based on NEX ICO template.
