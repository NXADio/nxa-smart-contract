<h3 align="center">Nxad smart contract</h3>
<p align="center">This current contract is NEP5 Compliant</p>



#### Considerations

The current smart contract is the first version of Nxad smart contract.
With this in mind, some modifications will still occur.
The smart contract is based on NEX ICO template.


#### Setup
To test as a owner of the contract replace TOKEN_OWNER variable with your wallet script hash.
The variable can be found in the file token.py
